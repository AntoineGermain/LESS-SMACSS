LESS-SMACSS
===========

I like scalable & modular CSS, so I like to use [Jonathan Snookâ€™s](https://twitter.com/snookca) [Scalable & Modular CSS](http://smacss.com/). 

I also like CSS preprocessors. For [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) I use [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

These skeleton stylesheets with comments are for my own use, for future WordPress projects. But feel free to do with them what you will, if they are of any use whatsoever.
